**Published:** January 14, 2025

## Context
After a national holiday in Japan, Vishal engaged in deep self-reflection and sought feedback to refine his learning strategy for the year 2025.

## The Shift in Strategy
Vishal initially created a detailed "roadmap" resolution list but realized it wasn't the most effective approach.

*   **2024 Achievement:** He successfully built **discipline and consistency**.
*   **2025 Goal:** The focus is now on **Efficiency**—getting more done in less time.

## New Methodology: Project-Based Learning
He decided to pivot away from a purely "bottom-up, theory-first" approach.

*   **Inspiration:** Advice to "build cool projects" and utilize AI tools to accelerate the process.
*   **Action Plan:**
    *   Concurrent learning of **Python**, **Math** (Math for ML course), and **Traditional Machine Learning**.
    *   Aiming to build full **project pipelines**.
    *   Following **Andrej Karpathy's advice**: Pick up a project, complete it, and publish it.

## Resources Mentioned
